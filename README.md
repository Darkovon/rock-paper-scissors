This is my rock, paper, scissors project. I will be using a few functions and loops to create a game that is playable via user input in the js console.

Had a lot of fun doing this one. The final version is index.html

I did it with a switch which was pretty fun. They don't exist in Python, or at least I never learned about them, so it was cool to use that feature.
